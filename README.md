# geomath
### A framework for geometry and maths

## Brief
geomath is a little framework made for computer graphics and numerical simulation. 
It provides all the common maths features needed in a simple API while providing high performance.
- Stack allocated Matrix and Vectors
- All common 3D and 4D transforms (perspective, rotations, ...)
- Cinematic of points

The framework is yet not documented, but it won't be to difficult to use it if you are familiar with numpy or Matlab.
However if you need examples take a look at [this example project](https://github.com/samiBendou/nbodies)
